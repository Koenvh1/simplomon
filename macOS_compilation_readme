# Mac compile readme
# to install meson on macOS (Sonoma) use brew:
#  * brew install meson
# this needs the Xcode command line tools as well:
#  * xcode-select --install
# and needs an up-to-date version of python 3
# and an installation of lua
#  * brew install lua
# N.B. the latest version of lua on brew is 5.4, but simplomon specifically asks for 5.3 (why -> figure out later)

# and an up-to-date version of libcurl (>8.5). Default with macOS Sonoma is 7.79
